## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
**Mimics a Real Interview Environment:** The system creates a virtual interview room where interviewers and candidates can talk and interact just like a real interview. It allows video, audio, or text-based interviews, so users can choose the best way to communicate. The platform is easy to use, making the interview process simple and smooth for everyone.

**Generates Relevant Questions Based on Candidate's Experience:** The system picks questions based on the candidate’s skills and job role to keep the interview relevant. It starts with easy ice-breaking questions to help the candidate feel relaxed. Then, it moves to technical or management-related questions, depending on the candidate’s experience. The questions can be chosen by AI or selected by interviewers to make sure they are accurate and meaningful.

**Evaluates Responses & Assigns Scores:** The system scores candidates' answers based on how correct, detailed, and relevant they are. It can use AI to evaluate answers or let interviewers score them manually. This helps keep the process fair and reduces any personal bias in the evaluation.

**Ensures Fairness by Scoring Interviewers & Candidates**: Interviewers receive scores based on how relevant their questions are to the candidate's expertise. Candidates are also scored based on how well they answer. A standardized scoring system is used to ensure that all applicants are assessed fairly.

**Helps Select the Best Candidates Efficiently:** The system calculates a final score for each candidate based on different factors. It also provides detailed reports to help HR and experts make better hiring decisions. By using data instead of personal opinions, it ensures a fair and unbiased selection process.
